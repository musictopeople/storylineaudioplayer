# storylineaudioplayer
audio player that allows user to follow a story line playing audio clips along the way.
As you click through the song list relevant parts of the story light up.  The basic audio functions are in line with a few added features in the JavaScript making sure songs don't play at the same time and also reloading a track once the user moves on to the next song.  Play, pause and volume up and down are always available to the user.  Definitely drop me a line and let me know any ideas you have!
