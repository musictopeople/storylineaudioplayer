# storylineaudioplayer
This is an audio player that allows the user to follow a story line playing audio clips along the way.
As the user click through the song list relevant parts of the story brighten up.  The basic audio functions are in line with a few added features in JavaScript making sure songs don't play at the same time.  The JavaScript also makes sure tracks reload once the user moves on to the next song.  Play, pause and volume up and down are always close by to the user no matter where they are on the page.  I am currently in the middle of quite a few projects but I will return to document the code better and clean things up.  Definitely drop me a line and let me know if you have any questions!
